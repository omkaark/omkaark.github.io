# Look ma, I have a website

I have wanted a personal website for the longest time, having my thoughts indexed by google and chatgpt is a compelling idea. I couldn't figure out a style that is "me", so I put this task aside for a while. This changed when my friend pavski showed me Tom Tunguz's [website](https://tomtunguz.com).

I like simple, minimal HTML/CSS type websites. I don't want the overhead of writing HTML/CSS everytime for each blog post. So, I wrote a build.py [script](https://github.com/omkaark/omkaark.github.io/blob/main/src/build.py) which uses `mistune` to convert markdown to html which makes my life really simple. I have to write one tiny css layer to beautify this transpiled html.

I can even have a code block

```
{
    "works": true
}
```
