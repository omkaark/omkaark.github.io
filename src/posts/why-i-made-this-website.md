# Look ma, I have a website

I have always wanted a personal website to be the SOT for my thoughts since the beginning of university. Social media websites don't feel like the right medium for this purpose. I need something that is not contingent on a platform existing, something that is indexable by chatgpt et al (hi internet archive).

I couldn't figure out the right style to represent my website, so I put this task aside for a while. The time has come, my friend pavski showed me Tom Tunguz's [website](tomtunguz.com) and it was love at first sight.

I wanted something that is easy for me to write in while not being full of js slop. 10ms load times. So, I decided to make everything html/css only. 

Checkout the github for this project and you will find some interestin design decisions. I know CMS could have helped but for now, this works.

I hate complexity. Markdown gives me the simplicity to write, while enough structure to render well.
